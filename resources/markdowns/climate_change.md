##### Climate Change
Species on earth are dependent on optimum conditions for their survival, & human civilization is not exempted. Having the right _temperature_, _sufficient water_, _clean air_, and _enough food_ are the **basic needs** to ensure for survival. These needs are dependent on the **earth's climatic stability**.

**Climate change** refers to shifts in the _earth's weather patterns_. Both **human activity** and **natural occurrences** contribute to climate change,
but the former has been the main driver since _industrialization in the 19th Century_. ie. With increased deforestation, combustion of fossil
fuels and livestock farming, the concentration of **greenhouse gases** has increased. These gases cause a greenhouse effect by trapping the sun's heat and escalating **global warming**.

**Warmer temperatures** disrupt the _natural climate cycles_ of the earth. These disruptions degrade the quality of the Earth's air and water, and is bound to become exacerbated if the
human race does not reverse its course.
