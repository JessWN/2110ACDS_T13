    "Living things are dependent on particular conditions to survive. Humans are not exempt from this. Having the right temperature, sufficient water, clean air, and enough food are among the basic requirements for survival. The majority of these requirements depend on the stability of climate change. Climate change refers to shifts in the weather and temperature patterns. Human activity and natural occurrences contribute to climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the 1800s, human cultures have been the main drivers of climate change. With increased deforestation, combustion of fossil fuels and increased livestock farming, the concentration of greenhouse gases has increased. These gases cause a greenhouse effect by trapping the sun's heat and escalating global warming.\n",

    "Warmer temperatures change weather patterns disrupting the natural conditions of the earth. These disruptions harm our environment, degrading the quality of the Earth's air and water.

    "\n",
    "In the 21st Century, more companies build their brand with the consideration of **lessened environmental impact** or **carbon footprint**. Thus, their operations products and services are inclined to being more **environmentally friendly** and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. <br>\n",
    "To improve market research on their products/services, we developed the folowing **ML project** that intends to determine how people **perceive climate change**, and _whether or not they believe it is a real threat_. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe this would provide a **metric** on how companies' products/service may be **received by the public**. Providing a robust ML solution will enable our clients to **access to a broad base of consumer sentiment**, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus **increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies**.<br>\n",
